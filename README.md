# ContinuousWaveletTransformApp
Research code for CWT thesis project

Application built using JUCE to research CWT's ability to identify constituent frequency components in a variety of audio sources.

Add a directory called "ResearchTestFiles" where you would like to hold your input audio sources and a directory called "ResearchOutputFiles" where you would like to save your additive files.  Adjust any necessary file paths in the project to the location of your directories.

Transport functionality for the additively reconstructed audio file is currently non-functioning, but relevant data is output to the console.
